# Pong-Game
A Pong Game that was created as part of the 100 days of coding challenge. 

The code consists of a scoreboard and 2 paddles. The right paddle is controlled by up and down keys and the left paddle by the W and S key. For each successful hit on the paddle the ball gets faster making it more challenging to hit the ball. 

If you miss the ball, a point is given to the opposing player.
